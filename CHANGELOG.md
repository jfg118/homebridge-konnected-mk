## [1.1.0](https://github.com/konnected-io/homebridge-konnected/compare/1.0.2...1.1.0) (2021-07-15)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes:
Apologies again, but there were some issues with the way that actuator/switches had their states triggered on the boards and the code has been refactored to make this feature more succinct and also semantic to the user.  In particular, if you have a switch that needs to change its trigger state (not the same as triggerable mode - that's different) from "high" to "low" --- instead of using "1" or "0", you instead use "high" or "low" respectively. 

As usual, please refer to the [README documentation](https://github.com/konnected-io/homebridge-konnected/blob/master/README.md) for the details.

* UI X configuration schema grammar/formatting cleanup. (0301958)
* Removes warnings tracing from the node monitor config (which blocked debugging). (969e7f2)
* Removes panic button feature from list (there's already a switch for the siren - we can use that). (86eac32)
* Adds shopping discount message to the README for Konnected users. (6457c81)
* Fixes header splash image URL link to point to Konnected's main website with utm parameter for analytics. (e5bb9ad)
* Adjusts the messaging of the triggerable modes for switches in the plugin configuration screen in Config UI X. (1ca8e24)
